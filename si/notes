biometric

optical character recognition

extracting text from the images

spam filtering

tagging

medical image processing

gesture recognition

recommender system

signal analysis

raw material will be identified by hitting signals

churn prediction

if a user buy 1 thing

max shopping

super marts data

if someone buy milk cheese, there is a prob that he will buy bread as well if u place it a the shopping counter

typical machine learning system:

-identify problem

-data collection and feature extraction

-model training

-evaluation

-deployment

how does machine learning work

input data

analyze data

find patterns

prediction

stores the feedback

in machine learning---machine do learning

computer donot retain thinks....we can do backtracking to solve this issue

in machine learning we have 3 things:

-problem solving

-dataset

-problem solving (learning)

-dataset (supervised,semi-supervised)

-labels

bagging and boosting:

using multiple models in semi-supervised learning

dataset:

collection of data by which we can extract useful information

it has features/attributes

there will be some key attributes

they'll help in catching patterns

testing is not done on the same on which our model is trained. We give training data to predict labels and then match the results with the real results

use suitable model for suitable problem

we choose the model based on the data given (dataset)

at evaluation step our model is trained now, we will go to prediction

we use formula of True Positive and True negative to check accuracy

first two are machine parts 

last two are human parts

precison: how many are correct TP+TN

accuracy: TP+TN+FP+FN

overfitting:

andaza kharab ho

it is trained on too much, that is give random results

underfitting: 0 precision 0 accuracy

less data it will cause underfitting

confusion matrix:

	T	F
T	TP	TN

F	FP	FN

based on this confusion matrix we calculate the accuracy and precision

types of machine learning:

supervised

unsupervised

reinforcement

some labels given while some are not given so we will try to predict those labels by using the labels given

table filling is done is reinforcement learning using bellmen equation. (it is actualling dataset filling) with result is stored in dataset and dataset is prepared in backend in dataset

in np hard problems, we go to genetic algorithms

classification 

regression: timeseries

continous data

we make predictions on the continuous data

continous data mean it is continuously changing

different b/w logistic and linear

linear->linear line

logistic->line can be in any shape

(sudden changes can occur)

e.g:

bitcoin value can rise and drop all of a sudden. In order to predict values in such cases we use logistic regression instead of linear

classification:

it make predictions on the static data. Which is not continuous, mean it is not changing.

based on some equation, it is classifying into 2 classes

classes are yes|no or true|false or 0|1

unsupervisesd:

groups are made in unsupervised learning

this/next point belongs to which group

reinforcement learning is used in gaming

overfitting and underfitting example given on register by bob

support: 

how much times a thing will come with other entries

how much time cheese will come with milk and bread 

how much time things will come together

conditional probability

confidence:

with a group how much time a single enty will come

e.g with a group of bread,cheese. how much time milk will come with this group. this is called as conditional probability

support:

which items should grouped. 

e.g should we group milk bread or cheese

this is called as support

min support,max support,min confidence,max confidences

these are threshold values

find trasaction whose min support 50 percent and min confidence 70 percent

when we find min support max support and make decision on basis of this, then this is called as aprori algorithm

before dataset, we've defined support as 50 percent and confidence on 70 percent. this is determine on past experiences and nature of the problem

confidence:

konsy elements k sath konsay new elements ko rakhna hy


video 7:

time series data: has two things

trade analysis

similarity check

time series data: data in continous form or data that is update

models that are applied on this type of data. They give the concept of timeseries data e.g forex, blast (predicting casualities). At backend of timeseries data. Regression is working

regression:

-dependent variable

-independent variable

corelation-relation between two variables 

it is denoted by b

it rely b/w 1 and -1 so that we optimize the value by fixing it in this range 

line that is on the trend is known as regression line

-1 to 1 limit show that regression line will lie in this range

if +2 to -2 then regression line will remain in this range

by this we will check the trend and on trend we will draw the regression line

the value of the trend recieve e.g 1, we will draw regression line on this point and we will do +2 and -2 to this line and we will get upper trend line and lower trend line from it. we decide ourself this value of 2. we can also +4 and -4 to the regression line

bx

x is dependent and x is independent
