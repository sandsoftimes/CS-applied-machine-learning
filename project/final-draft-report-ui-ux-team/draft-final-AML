Report on UI/UX Designing of FAST CHATBOT

Introduction of the TEAM:

Hello, i muhammad sharjeel akhtar alongside with my fellow member Rimsha Imran are working on the UI Design for our Chatbot. As you all know
the UI/UX  plays a pivotal role in the project, aimed at enhancing user interactions with the university through streamlined communication channels. The team's objective is to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates seamless interactions between users (students, faculty, and staff) and the chatbot.

Motivation:
The concept of optimizing the chatbot's interface is rooted in the goal of improving user experience, reducing time spent on repetitive interactions, and enhancing overall efficiency. Before delving into the design phase, it's imperative to validate this idea to ensure alignment with user needs and project objectives.

Chatbot UI Analysis through Research: We conducted a basic research, including forums, blogs, and analysis of existing user interactions, to gain insights into common queries, pain points, and user preferences regarding interface design.

Student Friendly Approach: We collaborated with our colleagues who are working in the UI Designing industry and retrieved some useful information on how we can make our interface as simple as possible so that to facilate the users who are going to use our chatbot. After doing some gaining some insights, we designed multiple UI's and hence forwarded them to the team for finalization.

User Interaction Evaluation:

The effectiveness of the chatbot's interface lies in its ability to facilitate smooth and intuitive interactions with users, addressing their queries effectively and efficiently. Gathering feedback and analyzing user interactions are crucial steps in evaluating and refining the interface design.

Consultation with the Front-End Team:

After designing multiple User-Interfaces, we consulted with the front-end team of our project in order to test out designs in terms of coding. Although, we found that some of the interfaces were pretty difficult to implement. Also, we were facing some tool limitations in terms of designing but all and all we managed to implement one of our choose interface into actual code for our project.

Use-Case Testing: Conducted usability testing sessions with representative users to observe their interaction with the interface, identify usability issues, and gather suggestions for improvement.

Multiple Testing Scenarios: Implement mechanisms within the interface to collect user feedback, such as surveys, suggestion boxes, or direct feedback channels, to continuously improve the user experience.

Concluding Remarks:
In conclusion, our Team tried to deliever the reliable interface that enhances user interactions and satisfaction for the Fast University Chatbot project. By validating the design concept through user research and usability testing, the team can create an interface that meets the evolving needs of students, faculty, and staff. Moving forward, continuous iteration and improvement based on user feedback will be essential to delivering a chatbot interface that optimizes user experience and achieves project objectives.
